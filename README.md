## Extra Homebrew Formulas

Just `brew tap nunofgs/homebrew-alt` and then `brew install nunofgs/alt/<formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install nunofgs/alt/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```sh
$ brew install https://raw.github.com/nunofgs/homebrew-alt/master/<formula>.rb
```````
